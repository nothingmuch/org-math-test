* OH HAI

i wrongly estimated less than $\frac{1}{10}$ chance that math works in org mode now that it's been added to markdown

more complicated expressions like $\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i}$ are apparently not recognized in org mode.

verbatim is ignored, which is good:

#+BEGIN_SRC tex
$\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i}$
#+END_SRC

display math doesn't seem to work at all with two dollars on their own lines:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^n x_{i}
$$

or work properly with backslashed brackets:

\[
\sum_{i=0}^n x_{i}
\]

as well as the inline variant with backslashed parens: \( \sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i}\)


compare with [[file:README.md][markdown]] version of the same.
